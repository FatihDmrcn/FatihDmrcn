### About my work
>Below, you have some screenshots showing my projects, which I coded during my studies (as part of lectures or simply out of interest). Feel free to have a look into my repositories. Unfortunately, I'm working very sporadically on these projects, so updates won't be done very frequently!

#### Examples
