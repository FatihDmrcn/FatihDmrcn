>Mechanical engineer using his leisure on some coding projects.

### About my work
>Below, you have some screenshots (and notes) showing my projects, which I coded during my studies (as part of lectures or simply out of interest). Feel free to have a look into my repositories. Unfortunately, I'm working very sporadically on these projects, so updates won't be done very frequently!

#### Examples
- Utilizing parallelization in Rust to quickly compute the RÂ² predicted statistic; and make it available with a Python package. It is meant to be enhanced for a more or less complete OLS analysis in Python, but using compiled Rust.
